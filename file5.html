We have the same dream and we also have the same goal which is to succeed in being excellent students and make our parents proud. I love my friends so much. I write this because this year is our last year together. Maybe our diploma story will end here, but our hearts will always be together forever. Thank you for accepting me as your good friend, without you all, it is impossible for me to get to this point. I love you guys so much !!</td>

    <td>This is my favorite food. This menu is a must for me every time I cook at home or go out to eat with my friends and family. This menu is special to me because the crunchiness of the fried chicken is very suitable with milk gravy. I would always cherish this food and always be my number one in my favorite food list.</td>
